## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

WebGL MRI volume visualization with THREE.js 

Volumes located in src/nrrd have been previously converted from Nifti(.nii) to Nrrd format.  



## Run the project locally <a name="#runLocally"></a>

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), v 20.1 was used for development.
Install [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a development server with live reload capability.

  - To install:
    
    ```
      npm create vite@latest
    ```

  - To run (from your local directory):
        
    ```
      npm run dev
    ```
  - And then move to src subfolder: 
        
    ```
      npx vite
    ```

This runs the *index.html* with the javascript and three js components from *script.js*.  

## Deployment - Live Website <a name="#deploymentLiveWebsite"></a>

[volume-viewer](https://volumeview-20a44.web.app/) live website is currently deployed on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), following vite [doc](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#google-firebase).
